# CDE-to-UMLS-Mapping-using-MetaMap
This is a temporary repository to share files with Kevin and Sofia,
Before Kevin completes creating his repository

1.)	UMLS to NCI Final zip file (includes the input file and main script file)
  a.	We did not address the symbols yet (I’m not sure if it was discussed with Denise)

2.)	NCI Tree Lineage Final zip file (includes the Excel input file and main script file)
  a.	As a result of the input file being in Excel format, we are able to do the conversion to csv UTF-8 within the Python script which results in a clean file without symbols

3.) NCI concept lineage retrieval from the EVS file (based on Wendy’s formula) script - not uploaded because Sofia is still working on it
